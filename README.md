## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS (SCSS)

### What I learned

`Nesting`: I learned how to nest CSS selectors in SASS, following the structure of my HTML. This made the CSS more organized.

`Variables`: I created SASS variables to store reusable values like colors.

`Mixins`: I used mixins to create reusable snippets of CSS. This helped me avoid code repetition.

`Inheritance with @extend`: I also learned how to use the `@extend` keyword to make a selector inherit the styles of another.

`Partials and Import`: I practiced breaking down styles into smaller, modular files (partials) and then importing them into a main stylesheet.

### Continued development

I plan to build more Frontend Mentor projects to help me sharpen my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.
